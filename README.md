# Tiling Utility - PenPot Plugin

**Note:** The project is in code freeze from December 15th 2024 to late January 2025.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

For building and launching a development server, do:

```bash
npm run build:dev
```

Due to building restrictions, hot reloading is **NOT** supported, builds need to be done manually!

## Building

To create a production version of the plugin:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

Upon push on main, the production build of the plugin will be deployed to github pages.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
